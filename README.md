# VG Balanced Bundle Decomposition
Algorithms to find balanced bundles and use them to further decompose a variantion graph.

## Project Objectives and Progress
### Main Objectives
 - [x] Bidirected graph with libhandlegraph.
 - [x] Balanced bundle finding algorithm described in *Describing the Local Structure of Sequence Graphs*.
 - [x] Bundle side adjancency relationship (none, weak, strong) algorithm.
 - [ ] Path connectedness algorithm that finds all path connected nodes.
 - [ ] TTSP algorithm.
 - [x] Port and test vg's acyclicity algorithm.
 - [x] Deserialize vg graph formats.
 - [ ] Compress bundles into nodes.
 - [ ] Use vg json representation.
### Side Objectives
 - [ ] Deprecate BidirectedGraphBuilder and add `serialize(ofstream&)` and ~~`deserialize(ifstream&)`~~(COMPLETED) to BidirectedGraph. Also support vg JSON format instead of legacy JSON format.
 - [x] Improve graph_assistant.py (add command line options for various tasks and improve code legibility).

## Tools
 1. Graph Assistant [(Python3)](test/graph_assistant.py)  
 Create and convert custom test graphs. Supports custom vg-inspired JSON format, vg compliant JSON format, and old legacy JSON format.
